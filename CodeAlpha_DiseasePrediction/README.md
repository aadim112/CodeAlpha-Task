# Disease Prediction System 🏥🤖

## Overview
This project implements a **Disease Prediction System** using machine learning techniques.  
The system predicts the **most probable disease** based on symptoms provided by the user.

It aims to assist in **early disease detection** and awareness using data-driven analysis.

---

## Features
- Symptom-based disease prediction
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and accuracy measurement
- Fast and reliable predictions

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn *(for visualization)*

---

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- Multiple symptoms as input features
- Disease labels as output classes

Each row represents a patient case with associated symptoms.

---

## Workflow
1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Encoding**
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Disease Prediction**

---

## Machine Learning Model
The project uses supervised learning algorithms such as:
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest *(if applied)*

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
