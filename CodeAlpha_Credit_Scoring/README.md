# Credit Scoring System 💳📊

## Overview
This project implements a **Credit Scoring System** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze customer financial data and predict **creditworthiness**, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

The model classifies customers into **good credit** or **bad credit** categories based on historical data.
