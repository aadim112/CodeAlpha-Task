# Handwritten Character Recognition ✍️🤖

## Overview
This project implements a **Handwritten Character Recognition System** using machine learning and image processing techniques.  
The model identifies and classifies handwritten characters from image data.

Such systems are commonly used in:
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Form digitization
- Automated document processing

---

## Features
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, normalization)
- Feature extraction from handwritten characters
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and accuracy measurement
- Character prediction from input images

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras *(depending on implementation)*


---

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of handwritten character images such as:
- MNIST (digits)
- EMNIST (characters)  
*(or a custom dataset, if used)*

Each image is labeled with its corresponding character.

---

## Workflow
1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Image Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Extraction**
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Character Prediction**

---

## Model
The system uses:
- Machine Learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest), **or**
- Deep Learning models (CNN)

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Loss curves
- Confusion matrix
